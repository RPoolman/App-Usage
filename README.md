# App-Usage

This project was built during my grad program at retro rabbit where each graduate had to build a mobile application that solves a problem they proposed.

The app was aimed to give easy access to the amount of time a user spends on his phone by supplying the user with a timely break down.

Later on ideas where to incorporate a family member system so that parents can monitor the time kids spend on there phone on which apps.
